=head1 NAME

evmuxd - Event Device Multiplexing Daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<evmuxd>
[-k keycode]
I<device>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool creates two Linux virtual keyboards and forwards the events from a
given physical keyboard to either of the two. It's possible to switch the
target of the redirect with a special key press.

This is useful when the user wants to assign a special purpose to one of the
keyboard while grabbing it (such as exporting the keyboard via L<btkbdd(8)>)
while still retaining the local keyboard functionality on his system.

The virtual keyboard have a sysfs attribute C<name> set to C<evmuxd primary>
and C<evmuxd secondary> with the primary one being chosen by default.

The default special key used is C<SCROLL LOCK>, and can be changed with the
-k option.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head1 EXAMPLES

Use with L<udev(7)> and L<systemd(1)> is recommended. Look into
F<89-evmuxd.rules> and F<evmuxd@.service> files distributed with evmuxd for
examples.

It's possible to create only two devices.

It's not possible to control the virtual keyboard metadata, such as name,
product and vendor IDs or version.

Only keyboard input devices are supported.
